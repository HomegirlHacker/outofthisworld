Developed by Amehja Williams & Sarah Lin for Kode With Klossy 2020 Summer Camp

# What's Your Teams Idea?
We plan to create a model of human impact on Earth and throughout the solar system.  

# Who Is It Built For?
People who are interested in humanity’s impact beyond earth

# What's Your Impact?
This model may aid in making projections of future human impact as humanity’s presence expands throughout the solar system (Moon, Mars, etc.).  

These projections can assist in developing plans for space exploration and for improving the environment.  

The focus of the idea is to demonstrate to consumers that humans have a much larger impact on our environment (both Earth and Space!) than what people normally think of (pollution, Global warming, etc.) and prevent interruption of satellites.

# Features To Be Added

Model of human impact from Earth’s soil to space junk, to the Moon
Predictions of human impact in solar system based off of current observations
