        <p class = "contentInfoTextIntro">If you've explored the "Spheres" page, you'll have learned about
          how humans have impacted Earth's subsystems.  However, the impact of humanity has 
          expanded far beyond Earth's surface.  In fact, mankind's impact has made its way through the farthest limits of the atmosphere, and has even reached other celestial bodies.

        <p class = "contentInfoTextIntro">LUNAR JUNKYARD:</p>

        <p class = "contentInfoText">During the many manned and unmanned trips to the moon, humans have left behind as much as 400,000 pounds (181,436 kg) of trash (Nicholson).  The image picture to the right was taken by the Luna 13 unmanned spacecraft, "the second Soviet spacecraft to successfully soft-land on the surface of the Moon" (Luna 13).  "Luna 13 achieved the Luna program's second soft landing, taking panoramic images of the surface and collecting more-detailed measurements of the lunar soil. Luna 13's batteries conked out two days after landing, and it remains at rest near its companion Luna 9 in the Ocean of Storms" (Stover).  Luna 13 is just one examples of <a href = "https://www.popsci.com/military-aviation-space/article/2007-05/junkyard-moon/">dozens of spacecraft 
        and other equipment</a> left behind on the lunar surface.<p/>

        <p class = "contentInfoText">As more concrete plans are developed to enhance humanity's 
          presence in space, the issue of space debris becomes more concrete as well.  The leftover junk 
          orbiting about Earth and piled up on the Moon could be recycled or reused, reducing waste and improving resource use.<p/>
