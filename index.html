  <p id = "welcomeStatement">Welcome to Out Of This World!</p>
  <p id = "missionStatement">We aim to create a model of human impact on Earth and throughout the solar system for those who are interested in humanity’s impact beyond earth. This model may aid in making projections of future human impact as humanity’s presence expands throughout the solar system (Moon, Mars, etc.). Furthermore, these projections may assist in developing plans for space exploration and for improving the environment. The focus of this site is to demonstrate to consumers that humans have a much larger impact on our environment (both Earth and Space!) than what people normally think of (pollution, Global warming, etc.) and to prevent interruption of satellites.</p>

<!-- INTRODUCTORY INFORMATION -->

<!-- $8 BILLION -->
<div id = "introductionContentDiv">
  <h4 id = "introductionContentParaTitle">$8 BILLION</h4>
  <h5 id = "introductionContentPara">That's how much potential revenue one could earn by recycling the millions of pieces of space junk orbiting around our planet.</h5>

<!-- WHAT IS SPACE JUNK -->
<div id = "introductionContentDiv">
  <h4 id = "introductionContentParaTitle">WHAT IS SPACE JUNK?</h4>
  <h5 id = "introductionContentPara">Space junk, or space debris, is the graveyard of leftover, damaged, and unused satellites, equipment, and other tools of the trade used to aid space exploration and research. These pieces of debris number in the thousands, forming a cloud of detritus around our planet.</h5>

<div id = "introductionContentDiv">
  <h4 id = "introductionContentParaTitle">HUMAN LITTER EXTENDS THAT FAR?</h4>
  <h5 id = "introductionContentPara">Indeed it does. Beyond the typical topics of environmental health, such as Global Warming, there are numerous lesser-known impacts humans make on Earth, and potentially throughout the solar system, if we are not careful. Being mindful of human impact not only on Earth, but also in space may aid in the development of resource-efficient plans for space exploration, preventing sattellite damage and disruption, manufacturing, and for improving the environment.
